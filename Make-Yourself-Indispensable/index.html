            Hi, my name is Marc and I'm gonna talk about how to make yourself insispensable at your job.

            This is gonna be some career-definition stuff for developers, so you may want to pay me a beer later.

					<h1>RULES</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            Well, there's basically two rules.
           
            Rule 1: I talk, you listen.
            Rule 2: You can (and should) talk if the screen shows a number and you have an envelope with that number

            Shall we try?

						Why the envelopes?

            I've been running this talk a lot of times (in my mind) since I wroted it (yesterday at the plane)
            and I know it needs a clever audience to make everything smooth.

            Clever people do the right questions at the same time. I know you a little and I know you are
            not those people.

            So, for everyone's sake, it's just going to be better if you don't improvise. Just stick to the
            envelopes and everything it's gonna be ok.

            All the stuff I'm gonna talk about works better if you start doing as soon as you start working
            somewhere. However, they are also useful when you have been there for a while. The main goal
            is to prevent you to have to find a new job.

            So, let's imagine that you just landed at your current job

          <aside class="notes">
						Let's face it. It's highly probable that in your company nobody will have a clue of the work you've done or what you actually do.

						If you follow my lead, we'll ensure that this continues the way it is.

						If you're not rated for your "real" work you'll have the opportunity to project an image of reliability and the one who always knows to do.

						You will agree that projecting an image is way more efficient than actually do a "good" job.

            So we will focus on projecting an image of a leader, someone who keeps everything under control, someone in who people will trust.

            I'll show you some amazing techniques to achieve that.

            There are 3 main key points that you should keep in mind all the time.
            If you maximize this 3 factors I garantee that you'll have a long and

					<h1>Maximize Entropy</h1>
					<img src="img/entropy.jpg"/>
          <aside class="notes">
            I'm talking, of course, about the right definition of Entropy: the amount of chaos in a system.
            How much information every piece of that system gives about the whole system.

            Systems tend to increase it's internal disorder. You have to do a conscious effort to decrease the entropy of a system.

            Ok, don't do it!

            In fact, if you're going to put effort on anything (and I'm almost always against putting effort to things) you have to try to increase entropy.

            You will find that you have a lot to gain in a chaotic system.
            Everything will more difficult to understand, and learn one thing won't give you points to learn another part of the system.

            Ok, that's the 101. If you write a lot of code your name
            will be everywhere and people will start thinking that you
            are an important person inside the organization

            Also, more code means more entropy. So whenever possible, you
            should write more, not less code

          <aside class="notes">
            A better way is to duplicate, but with minor changes everywhere.
            That way, nobody will be really sure what the code is actually doing
            and they will be really affraid to change your code. You will keep
            the ownership ;)

					<h1># TODO</h1>

            TODO is one of the most powerful words in your career!

            When you find a TODO, you think that something should have been
            done. But it's not! So.. should I do it? it's that still relevant?

            Try to use TODO in a defensive way when you write crappy code.

            Bonus points if you make the TODO survive the original code.

					<h1>Tests</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            Not writing tests is not an option. Tests are code, and like I said,
            you should write a lot of code.

            But you can always write tests in a way that they don't really make
            anyone's life easier. Test your already-tested dependencies, for example.

            Or make tests so heavy that no one would like to run them 

            Also, if you learn to make a lot of tests that could break without
            meaning that the code is broken everyone will be a bit more scared all
            the time.

            Be creative there. One tip: try tests that depend on time so they can
            fail randomly.

            That leds me to the next point
